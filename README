# Fashion MNIST Classification Workshop

Welcome to the Fashion MNIST Classification Workshop! In this session, you'll learn how to build, train, and evaluate a neural network that can accurately classify clothing items from the Fashion MNIST dataset. This workshop is designed for beginners and intermediate learners interested in deep learning and image classification.

## Getting Started

Before we dive in, make sure you have the following prerequisites ready:

- Python 3.x installed
- Familiarity with basic Python programming
- An installed version of TensorFlow and Keras
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE of your choice

## Installation

To set up your environment for the workshop, follow these steps:

1. Clone the workshop repository:


2. Install the required Python packages:


## Workshop Structure

The workshop is divided into the following sections:

1. **Introduction to TensorFlow and the Fashion MNIST dataset**
2. **Loading and Preprocessing the Data**
3. **Model Architecture**
- Building a simple 3-layer neural network
4. **Model Compilation**
- Configuring the model for training
5. **Model Training**
- Training the model and validating its accuracy
6. **Model Evaluation**
- Assessing the model's performance on the test set
7. **Experimentation**
- Encouraging participants to tweak the model to improve performance

Each section is accompanied by a Jupyter Notebook cell or markdown explanation, guiding you through the concepts and practical implementations.
