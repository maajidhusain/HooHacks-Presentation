# Superhero Classification Workshop

Welcome to the Superhero Classification Workshop! This unique session is designed to introduce participants to the fascinating intersection of machine learning and comic book superheroes. Using a curated dataset and a pre-trained model, we'll explore how to classify superheroes based on various attributes and characteristics.

## Getting Started

To ensure a smooth experience, please ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
- TensorFlow installed, as we will be loading a pre-trained model.

## Installation

Follow these steps to prepare your environment:

1. Download the workshop materials:
   - No specific repository clone required. Ensure you have the provided files: `best_model.h5`, `superheroes.csv`, and `workshop_material.ipynb`.

2. Install necessary Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow pandas matplotlib jupyter
    ```

## Workshop Overview
The workshop is structured as follows:

### Introduction
Overview of the problem space and the tools we'll be using.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Dive into [`superheroes.csv](superheroes.csv) to understand our dataset.

### Model Architecture and Creation
- Adding layers and dropout layers to an LSTM model
- **Still has not been refined and needs vast improvement**

### Making Predictions
Apply our model to new data and interpret the results.

### Interactive Jupyter Notebook
[workshop_material.ipynb](workshop_material.ipynb) contains step-by-step guidance for each section.
